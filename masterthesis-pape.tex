\section{Introduction}

Interactivity and collaboration are core characteristics of Web 2.0 applications.

\section{Approach}

\subsubsection{DialogMap}

In order to test the initial idea of supporting public deliberation through spatially enhanced dialogues, a working prototype had to be developed.

Developed with potential users.

Input and opinions on features



\subsubsection{Design decisions}

As seen in X,Y and Z, important aspects of A are\dots

\subsubsection{Implementation}
\textit{DialogMap} has been implemented as a single-page web application using AngularJS\footnote{\url{http://angularjs.org/}} and Ruby on Rails\footnote{\url{http://rubyonrails.org/}}. The single-page structure was chosen in order to provide the user with a clear navigation between the overview and contribution answers. This also allows for a seamless browsing experience without full reloads of the page. AngularJS is a JavaScript framework with features like templating, two-way binding and DOM manipulation. It follows the model-view-controller pattern in order to bring server side paradigms to client-side development. AngularJS was chosen because of its popularity, extensibility and high number of available libraries. It also enables to wrap existing JavaScript libraries to be used in AngularJS context.\\
The mapping library Leaflet\footnote{\url{http://leafletjs.com/}} serves as base for displaying base maps and geospatial data. The user-facing web page was developed using tools like CoffeeScript\footnote{\url{http://coffeescript.org/}}, Haml\footnote{\url{http://haml.info/}} and Sass\footnote{\url{http://sass-lang.com/}} to speed up the development. The web page was developed with all major browsers in mind.\\
On the server side, components were developed using the Ruby on Rails framework with PostgreSQL\footnote{\url{http://www.postgresql.org/}}/PostGIS\footnote{\url{http://postgis.net/}} as data storage. Ruby on Rails, originally a full-stack model-view-controller web framework, is used as a JSON serving application logic. It was chosen because of its maturity and high number of available libraries. Front- and backend of the application communicate in REST\footnote{Representational State Transfer}-API\footnote{Application programming interface} like manner. This allows for easily replaceable front- and backend application stacks.\\
Without the extensive use of open source software and code, development would have taken much longer. It is planned to release the source code through github\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ubergesundheit/dialogmap}}.

% Balancing columns in a ref list is a bit of a pain because you
% either use a hack like flushend or balance, or manually insert
% a column break.  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=balance
% multicols doesn't work because we're already in two-column mode,
% and flushend isn't awesome, so I choose balance.  See this
% for more info: http://cs.brown.edu/system/software/latex/doc/balance.pdf
%
% Note that in a perfect world balance wants to be in the first
% column of the last page.
%
% If balance doesn't work for you, you can remove that and
% hard-code a column break into the bbl file right before you
% submit:
%
% http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2149854/how-to-manually-equalize-columns-
% in-an-ieee-paper-if-using-bibtex
%
% Or, just remove \balance and give up on balancing the last page.
