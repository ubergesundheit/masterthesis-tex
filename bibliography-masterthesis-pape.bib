The article first traces the social history of {PPGIS}. It then argues that {PPGIS} has been socially constructed by a broad set of actors in research across disciplines and in practice across sectors. This produced and reproduced concept is then explicated through four major themes found across the breadth of the {PPGIS} literature: place and people, technology and data, process, and outcome and evaluation. The themes constitute a framework for evaluating current {PPGIS} activities and a roadmap for future {PPGIS} research and practice.},

Structured in three consecutive steps, the model is based on the view that stakeholders, experts, and citizens should each contribute to the planning effort their particular expertise and experience. Stakeholders are valuable resources for eliciting concerns and developing evaluative criteria since their interests are at stake and they have already made attempts to structure and approach the issue. Experts are necessary to provide the data base and the functional relationships between options and impacts. Citizens are the potential victims and benefactors of proposed planning measures; they are the best judges to evaluate the different options available on the basis of the concerns and impacts revealed through the other two groups. The three-step model has been developed and frequently applied as a planning tool in West Germany. We compare this experience with the model's first application in the United States, and conclude that the three-step procedure offers a limited, but promising future for democratizing policy making in the United States.},

@article{Wright2007_deliberation_design,
    abstract = {Within democratic theory, the deliberative variant has assumed pre-eminence. It represents for many the ideal of democracy, and in pursuit of this ideal, online discussion forums have been proposed as solutions to the practical limits to mass deliberation. Critics have pointed to evidence which suggests that online discussion has tended to undermine deliberation. This article argues that this claim, which generates a stand-off between the two camps, misses a key issue: the role played by design in facilitating or thwarting deliberation. It argues that political choices are made both about the format and operation of the online discussion, and that this affects the possibility of deliberation. Evidence for the impact of design (and the choices behind it) is drawn from analysis of European Union and {UK} discussion forums. This evidence suggests that we should view deliberation as dependent on design and choice, rather than a predetermined product of the technology.},

Results indicate that team performance is improved by explicit referencing mechanisms. However, when Explicit Referencing is implemented in a way that is detrimental to the linearity of the conversation, resulting in the visual dispersion or scattering of messages, its use has negative consequences for collaborative work at a distance. The role of a linear message history in the collaboration mechanisms was equally important than that of Explicit Referencing.},

This article studies how geoportals can benefit from the Web 2.0 features. Geoportals are World Wide Web gateways that organize content and services related to geographic information. They are the most visible part of Spatial Data Infrastructures (i.e. distributed systems that aid acquisition, processing, distribution, use, maintenance, and preservation of spatial data). Today's geoportals are focusing on interoperability through the implementation of standards for discovery and use of geographic data and services. Will tomorrow's Geoportals focus more on organising communities of users sharing common interests? Recent papers are arguing for deeper integration of the Web 2.0 paradigm within the geospatial web. This article aims to provide an overview supporting the next generation geoportal development by defining related concepts, by emphasising advantages and caveats of such an approach, and proposing appropriate implementation strategies.},

@article{Cai2009_spatial_annotation_deliberation,
    abstract = {Many public policies and decisions deal with geospatially expressed problems that are complex and controversial in nature. Broad participation of all interested parties in the form of deliberative dialogues is crucial to making trustworthy decisions. However, supporting deliberative dialogues on spatial problems places unique requirements for technology mediation that go beyond the current state of research on public participation geographical information systems ({PPGIS}) and related technologies. In this article, we analyze the challenges of facilitating effective deliberation processes and highlight the progress needed to support spatially-enabled public deliberation technologies. Then, we present our {GeoDeliberative} Annotation Technology ({GeoDAT}) as a framework for addressing the above challenges. {GeoDAT} uses spatial annotation objects as models for deliberative artifacts, and manages annotations by a spatial data model that reflects the ecological relationships among annotations, visual contexts, discussion threads, spatial referents, and the cognitive states of their holders. As a proof of the concept, we have implemented {GeoDeliberator} based on the {GeoDAT} framework. {GeoDeliberator} is based on Web 2.0 technology and implemented in {AJAX} technology, and it offers some unique spatial annotation capture, retrieval and visualization capabilities, such as context memory, reference to multiple geo-objects in one annotation, inferring and visualizing new relations using spatial-temporal and thread-based reasoning, and user-controlled annotation sharing. We demonstrate the utility of {GeoDeliberator} through a simulated scenario where a community in a university campus deliberates on the alternative courses of actions available for building a smoke-free campus.},

In this overview, the research findings are analyzed in terms of the following overarching issues essential to a comprehensive theory of collaboration: (a) a definition of collaboration, (b) the auspices under which a collaboration is convened and the role of the convener, (c) implications of the collaboration for environmental complexity and participants' control over the environment, and (d) the relationship between individual participants' self-interest and the collective interests of all involved in the collaborative alliance.

E-government clearly has the potential to become an institution that helps to ensure reasoned reflection about political issues and active participation in deliberative democracy by citizens and by members of the government. Though the Internet presents innovative new methods for conveying government information to citizens, it also presents new and serious potential impediments to deliberative democracy, such as group polarization about political issues by online social groups. The ability of e-government sites either to foster democratic dialogue by presenting multiple viewpoints or to enable polarization on political issues by promoting specific views demonstrates a key question about the conceptual foundations of e-government. Drawing upon perspectives from information studies, public policy, law, and governance, this article examines the differing political implications between e-government built on a foundation of participation and on a foundation of polarization.},

This article uses survey data to explore hypotheses about whether means of communication shape contacting activity. It compares Internet-based contacts with traditional contacts, showing statistically significant but for the most part substantively small differences. Effects of technology are of two kinds, those affecting only the likelihood of citizens being active in communicating with government and those affecting the frequency or intensity of communication among those who are active. The article discusses these findings in terms of transitional effects of technology, which arise from uneven distribution of the technology in society, and in terms of inherent effects, which attend to the technology itself. The most important inherent effects involve gender and political connectedness: The gender gap in contacting is larger on the Internet than in traditional forms of communication, and political connectedness has a weaker association with communication through the Internet.},

To understand this research better, we used content analysis of eighty-four papers in e-government-specific research outlets (two journals and one conference series). Our analytical focus took in five main aspects: perspectives on the impacts of e-government, research philosophy, use of theory, methodology and method, and practical recommendations. Normative evaluation identified some positive features, such as recognition of contextual factors beyond technology, and a diversity of referent domains and ideas. Alongside this, though, research draws mainly from a weak or confused positivism and is dominated by over-optimistic, a-theoretical work that has done little to accumulate either knowledge or practical guidance for e-government. Worse, there is a lack of clarity and lack of rigor about research methods alongside poor treatment of generalization. We suggest ways of strengthening e-government research but also draw out some deeper issues, such as the role of research philosophy and theory, and the institutional factors – particularly pressures of competition and time – that may constrain development of e-government as a research field.},

However, beyond the general imperative to participate, major policy bodies offer little guidance on what this entails. We suggest that the dominance of Arnstein's ladder of citizen participation in policy discourses constrains the ways we think about, and critically the purposes we ascribe to, participation in a climate change context. We suggest an alternative framing of climate change, where no single group has clear access to understanding the issue and its resolution. Thus adaptation is fundamentally dependent on new forms of learning. Drawing on experiences of social learning approaches to natural resource managing, we explore how a commitment to social learning more accurately embodies the new kinds of role, relationship, practice and sense of purpose required to progress adaptive climate change agendas and practices.

We introduce a group communication theory, the Collective Information Sharing ({CIS}) bias, and discuss how it relates to communicative goals that need to be considered when designing collaborative, visually enabled, spatial?decision?support tools. The {CIS} bias framework suggests that key goals for developing such tools should be: (a) the harnessing of a group's collective knowledge emerging from collaborative discussions and (b) reducing the repeat of information that has already been shared within the group. We propose that web?accessible, map annotation tools are ideally suited to advancing these goals and outline how the {CIS} bias framework informs how geospatial annotation tools can maximize the potential of collaborative efforts. We offer design recommendations for annotation tools that function to: (a) facilitate access to and recall of geographically referenced discussion contributions, (b) document ideas for private as well as public discussion spaces, and (c) elicit all group members to contribute information in a given collaborative effort.},

@article{Susha2012_eParticipation,
    abstract = {It has been widely acknowledged recently that the research field of {eParticipation} suffers from lack of comprehensive theoretical contributions, insufficient depth, and inconsistency in definitions of central concepts. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field researchers find it difficult to consolidate their theoretical groundwork and further theory building in the {eParticipation} domain. This paper reports a literature study of conceptual publications on the subject of {eParticipation}/{eDemocracy} in the time frame of 2007–2009. Its objectives are to track recent theoretical development in the field, to reveal constraints and limitations to researching the area, and to offer some suggestions for further inquiry. The results show that most theories currently used in conceptual {eParticipation} research originate from the fields of Political Science and Media and Communication Studies. But together with this, contemporary {eParticipation} authors contribute to strengthening the field with some  ” in-house” models and frameworks as well. Central problems with {eParticipation} research concern immaturity of the field, topical gaps, and biased assumptions. The review shows that the themes of recent publications can be grouped into three major categories: stakeholders, environment, and applications and tools. It also finds some interconnections between these categories; however, in general the coupling technology–stakeholders–(participatory) environments is weak. \^{a}º The study offers a thematic map of research and topical suggestions for the future. \^{a}º Themes in recent research concern stakeholders, environment, applications and tools. \^{a}º Theories from political science and media studies dominate in {eParticipation} research. \^{a}º {eParticipation} research is limited by immaturity, topical gaps, and biased assumptions.},

    abstract = {Research on the use of information technology to support democratic decision-making ({eParticipation}) is experiencing ongoing growth, stimulated by an increasing attention from both practitioner and research communities. This study provides the first longitudinal analysis of the development of the {eParticipation} field based on a shared framework, capturing the directions that the research field of {eParticipation} is taking in recent developments. Drawing on a literature search covering the period from April 2006 to March 2011, this study identifies, analyzes, and classifies 122 research articles within the categories of {eParticipation} actors, activities, contextual factors, effects, evaluation, and methods. Findings show that the field has a high level of dynamism, as foci on {eParticipation} activities, contextual factors, and effects have shifted in time, sometimes in counterintuitive directions. The study also suggests new analytical categories of research. Drawing on the analysis, inputs for a research agenda are suggested. These include the need to move beyond a technological perspective, encouraging the ongoing shift of research focus from government to citizens and other stakeholders, and the need to make {eParticipation} research methods more participatory in nature. \^{a}º I analyze 122 research articles on {eParticipation} published in the period 2006–2011. \^{a}º I provide a longitudinal view of the shifts in {eParticipation} research foci. \^{a}º I highlight evidence-based inputs for a revised {eParticipation} research agenda.},

Understanding such an emerging field is a complex endeavor because there is no generally agreed upon definition of the field, no clear overview of the research disciplines or methods it draws upon, and because the boundaries of the field are undecided. Using conventional literature review techniques, we identify 131 scientific articles considered important for the field's theoretical development. This sample provides the starting point for a grounded analysis leading to the development of an overview model: the field of {eParticipation} seen from a researcher's perspective. The model provides structure for understanding the emerging shape of the field as well as an initial indication of its content. It also provides the basis for developing research agendas for the future.},

@incollection{austerschulte2010,
    abstract = {An argumentation map is an online discussion forum for spatially related topics that combines the forum with an interactive map. The utility of an argumentation mapping tool highly depends on the accuracy and quantity of the geo-tags that link the discussion contributions to geographic locations. These geo-tags can be created manually by the users of the argumentation map or automatically by a geo-parsing application. However, in the case of manual geo-tagging users often do not create geo-tags as extensively as desired. In contrast, automatic geo-parsers have difficulties with the informal language often used in user-generated content and with resolving small-scale features.
                          This paper proposes a hybrid approach for geo-tagging user-generated content which involves the users in the process but supports them with an automatic geo-parser which suggests locations. The implementation of a prototype as well as a human participants test are presented in order to analyze the geo-tagging performance of this approach. It turns out that it is possible to reduce the number of geo-tagging errors but keep the recall rate approximately constant, compared to automatic geo-parsers.},
