Public deliberation conducted by citizen initiatives is an important part of the democratic foundation of our society. Currently Internet pages, meetings and newspaper advertisements are used as medium for deliberation. This thesis tries to answer how the use of spatially enhanced dialogs could support deliberation performed by citizen initiatives by providing a citizen initiative with an online spatial discussion platform. Evaluation then focuses on answering this question through semi-structured interviews, expert interviews and a focus group. Results showed some impediments but general helpfulness for supporting public deliberation performed by citizen initiatives through spatially enhanced dialogs.
