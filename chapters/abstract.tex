Public deliberation conducted by citizen initiatives is an important part of the democratic foundation of our society. Mostly Internet pages, meetings and newspaper advertisements are used as medium for deliberation. This thesis tries to answer how using spatially enhanced dialogs could support deliberation performed by citizen initiatives by providing a citizen activists with an online spatial discussion platform. Evaluation through semi-structured interviews, expert interviews and a focus group aims on answering the question how support could manifest itself. Results showed some impediments but general helpfulness for supporting public deliberation performed by citizen initiatives through spatially enhanced dialogs.
