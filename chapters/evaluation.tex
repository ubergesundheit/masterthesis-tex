\section{Evaluation}
\label{chap:evaluation}
Subsequently to \hyperref[chap:methodology]{section \ref{chap:methodology}}, which covered evaluation techniques applied, this section will present findings inferred from the replies recorded in the semi-structured interviews (\hyperref[sub:ev_interviews]{sub-section \ref{sub:ev_interviews}}), expert interviews (\hyperref[sub:ev_expert_interviews]{sub-section \ref{sub:ev_expert_interviews}}) and focus group (\hyperref[sub:ev_focus]{sub-section \ref{sub:ev_focus}}).


\subsection{Semi-structured Interviews}
\label{sub:ev_interviews}
Two of the eight participating respondents were female. Except two, all respondents are involved in the organization of the sustainability project. The other two are members of a citizen foundation in M{\"u}nster. Because of the anonymization of the interviews, participants and will be denoted as P1 to P8 in the following sections.\\
As mentioned in \hyperref[chap:methodology]{section \ref{chap:methodology}}, the responses were categorized to emphasize and expose important information. The exposed categories are ``Benefits and goals of public deliberation'', ``Current citizen-initiative communication means'', ``Benefits gained through the deployment of the prototype'', ``Advantages of the prototype over other solutions considered'', ``Disadvantages of the prototype'' and ``Other use cases for the prototype''.\\

According to the respondents, public deliberation is a step to self-determined organization of society (P2, P3, P5). One of the most important aspect of it are the ability of citizens to participate and actively shape their environment (P2, P3, P5, P6, P7). Public deliberation allows to pass on experience (P4, P8) and fosters  Power comes from the people (P5, P7), so that strengthening the public through deliberation
