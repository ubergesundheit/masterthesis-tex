\section{Evaluation}
\label{chap:evaluation}
Subsequently to \hyperref[chap:methodology]{section \ref{chap:methodology}}, which covered evaluation techniques applied, this section will present findings inferred from the replies recorded in the semi-structured interviews (\hyperref[sub:ev_interviews]{sub-section \ref{sub:ev_interviews}}), expert interviews (\hyperref[sub:ev_expert_interviews]{sub-section \ref{sub:ev_expert_interviews}}) and focus group (\hyperref[sub:ev_focus]{sub-section \ref{sub:ev_focus}}).


\subsection{Semi-structured Interviews}
\label{sub:ev_interviews}
Two of the eight participating respondents were female. Except two, all respondents are involved in the organization of the sustainability project. The other two are members of a citizen foundation in M{\"u}nster. As the interviews were anonymized, participants and will be denoted as P1 to P8 in the following sections.\\
As mentioned in \hyperref[chap:methodology]{section \ref{chap:methodology}}, the responses were categorized to emphasize and expose important information. The exposed categories are ``Benefits and goals of public deliberation'', ``Current citizen-initiative communication means'', ``Attributes of spatial discussion platforms which support dialogs and public deliberation'' and ``Other use cases for spatial discussion platforms''.\\ % ``Attributes disadvantageous for dialogs and public deliberation''

According to the respondents, public deliberation is a step to self-determined organization of society (P2, P3, P5) and a method to inform oneself (P1). One of the most important aspect is the ability of citizens to actively shape their environment through participation (P2, P3, P5, P6, P7). Public deliberation allows to pass on experience (P4, P8) and fosters discussions (P1, P2). P5 and P7 indicated that public deliberation strengthens thus allowing the public to become an opposition to powerful corporations and the government. Generally, public deliberation is understood as an act of doing useful things together.

Currently, internal communication in initiatives is done mostly through mailing lists, e-mails and meetings. P2, P5, P7 and P8 name the use of Internet pages with simple lists and texts to transport information to the public. A wiki web application was mentioned by P7. Newspaper advertisements as medium were named by P2 and P6. In addition to that, brochures and flyers were used (P4, P8). According to P6 online PDF documents are also used. Telephone meetings and Trello\footnote{\url{https://trello.com/}} or other project management software were named by P5 and P3 respectively. P2 added the use of paper maps as mean to transport information. Knowledge of online tools for creating interactive maps was generally low.

Nearly all respondents mentioned the informing of the public through spatial discussion platforms as useful attribute. The ability to gain a spatial overview of the topic (P1, P3, P4, P5, P7) and a sense of proximity to projects (P7, P8) were also mentioned as advantageous attributes for public deliberation. Visualization of proximity was also named as an incentive for users to participate (P3, P4, P5, P7). Discouraging factors for participation through spatial discussion platforms were low usability, application errors and unstructured discussions according to most of the respondents (P2, P3, P5, P6, P7). P7 also mentioned no initial content as impeding factor. Communication, as well as acquaintances, ideas and execution of ideas are believed to be sparked through the creation of spatial references in discussions (P2, P5). The same was said about data collection. Digitization of projects is said to inspire more contributions and discussions (P2, P8). The ubiquitousness of Internet use is believed to allow the general public to engage others in discussions (P2, P5). On the other hand, concerns about excluding groups without Internet access were raised by P1, P2 and P7. According to P7, even without the use of Internet technologies, public deliberation is highly socially selective. In addition to that, P2, P3 and P4 raised privacy concerns and unclear data protection. P4 and P7 believed the requirement to create user accounts could dampen spontaneous contributions. If the context, in which the application is deployed and reuse of contributions are not clearly communicated, acceptance will be generally low (P2, P8). Low acceptance induced by low publicity were also named by P2, P3, P5 and P7. Generally, graphic representation of objects in the discussions are considered useful (P2, P7, P8). Displaying markers and polygons on a map allows users to easily grasp the density of projects in different areas (P7). P7 also mentioned that unpleasing visual appearance could deter users from contributing. Additionally, interactivity enables users to understand the connection between a project and its location (P4, P6). Possible monetary costs of deployment and maintenance as negative factors for online spatial discussion platforms were mentioned by P4. 

The use of a spatial discussion platform as an organizational tool mentioned the most by respondents. Conveyance of information of all sort was named by P2, P5 and P6. P7 came up with the idea to display open data produced by governments through a spatial discussion platform.

\subsection{Expert Interviews}
\label{sub:ev_expert_interviews}
As mentioned earlier, expert interviews were conducted with Carsten Ke{\ss}ler and Tobias Heide. Statements will be denoted E1 and E2 respectively.


% Applications that support discussions through spatial features?
% E1:
% Emergency Response maps
% Benefits:
% bijectivity of features and object makes immediately clear about what the discussion is about
% E2:
% ArguMap

To the question to knowledge about spatial discussion platforms, E2 mentioned ArguMap\footnote{short for argumentation map}. E1 counted emergency response maps to the class of spatial discussion platforms. He states that bijectivity between features and objects supports mutual understanding of what discussions are about.

% Use cases for the connection of spatial features with discussions?
% E1:
% Literally everything
% E2:
% public participation
% organization
"Literally everything"\footnote{E1: Ich k{\"o}nnte mir das relativ grob strukturiert eigentlich {\"u}berall vorstellen.} could be the use case for linking discussions with spatial features according to E1. Public participation and involving citizens in planning processes are named by E2 for use cases.
% Solutions for bringing together citizens with initiatives/politicians?
% E1:
% Petition portals
% E2:
% Town Hall meetings
% public postings


% Connection of spatial features with discussions is helpful in the context of public deliberation?
% E1:
% yes
% E2:
% yes
% but: steep learning curve
% usability must be good
% easy to exclude non-tech-savy persons
The idea to include spatial references in discussion contributions in public deliberation is received positively by both experts. 
% In comparison to applications you know, what do you think about
% Omitting the spatial features of the replies in the overview?
% E1:
% good for clarity
% but focus is on the creator of the topic
% E2:
% good idea to prevent cluttering of map
% Two Way- Highlighting of spatial features and contribution rectangles
% E1:
% Important aspect for comprehensibility
% E2:
% helps the user to see the relationships 
% Filter and sorting
% E1:
% Filter is less important with only a few contributions
% Many options to choose from, wishes more explanation
% E2:
% As expected
% Compose and reply forms
% E1:
% generally good
% E2:
% Categories are not good enough explained and multiple categories are confusing
% Connection of words with spatial features, links and references to existing spatial features
% E1:
% Not very intuitive.
% icons not self explanatory
% E2:
% Geocoding and automatic location suggestion would be helpful
% not very intuitive
% Favoring of contributions
% E1:
% good measure for popularity of a contribution
% but no incentives to use the function
% toggle button is not visible at plain sight
% E2:
% generally good idea
% no incentives to use
% Registration and Sign in
% E1:
% standard, everything as expected
% E2:
% as expected
% Social Login
% E1:
% state-of-the-art
% E2:
% good idea. makes it easier for people
% Do you think Dialogues will be supported?
% E1:
% Discussion with tools is generally difficult
% Depends on moderation tools
% Small sidebar leads focus more on the map, not on the discussion
% E2:
% Depends on type of dialogues
% Needs more evaluation
% Missing Features
% E1:
% List of favored contributions for the user as bookmarking tool
% List of contributions the user has contributed to
% unread topics
% E2:
% spatial search
% geocoding of words
% Reasons not to participate through this tool
