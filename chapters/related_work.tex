By defining eight levels of increasing citizen participation, Arnstein \cite{Arnstein1969_citizen_participation} coined the term ``ladder of citizen participation'' which, since then, has been adapted and modernized \cite{Connor1988_new_ladder,carver2003future,Collins2009_social_learning,you2009_participatory_map_based,Cai2009_spatial_annotation_deliberation} by several authors. She claims that citizen participation is a term for the redistribution of power among citizen.

Similarly, Wiedemann and Femers \cite{Wiedemann1993355} proposed a ladder which is based on the premise that information given to the public and amount of possible participation is collateral. By requiring the implementation of the previous steps before the higher levels can be reached, Each step on their ladder leads to more and more empowerment of citizens. Wiedemann and Femers conclude that general understanding of an issue is a first step towards public participation.

In reaction to the ladder proposed by Arnstein, Connor \cite{Connor1988_new_ladder} constructs his version of a new ladder ``whose elements have a cumulative effect''. It is designed lead decision makers to apply techniques ``to prevent and resolve public controversy about various proposals''.

In 2009, Collins and Ison \cite{Collins2009_social_learning} suggested that the traditional ladders of Arnstein and colleagues are too dominating in citizen participation in policy discourses. They propose to focus more on the social learning aspect of participation which builds upon convergence of goals, co-creation of knowledge and change of behavior and actions. If all participants and stakeholders apply this ``social learning'', understanding is supported.

A three step procedure to apply public participation was proposed by Renn et al. in 1993 \cite{Renn1993_participation}. Participants can be divided into three groups. Stakeholders which bring concerns and interests, as well as metrics for evaluation. Experts serve as base for related data and to uncover functional relationships between options and their impacts. Finally, citizens assess the results and outcomes of the proposes of the other groups
