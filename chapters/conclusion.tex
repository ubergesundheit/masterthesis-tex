\section{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

This work discusses the implementation and quantitative evaluation of an prototype to support public deliberation through spatially enhanced dialogues in a specific context.

\subsection{Future Work}
Pick up shortcomings emerged during evaluation. Point to solutions. Mention recommendations from interviewers (Geocoder, list of favorites of each user, tasks)

Feature idea: let users upload geodata.

Maybe pick up unimplemented things from literature

Legal implications of running such a website have to be explored.
