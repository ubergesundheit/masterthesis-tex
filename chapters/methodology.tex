\section{Methodology}
\label{chap:methodology}
This section will give insight into the development process and chosen evaluation methods (\hyperref[subchap:ev_methodology]{section \ref{subchap:ev_methodology}}).

\subsection{Development Methodology}
As already stated in \hyperref[sub:dialogmap]{section \ref{sub:dialogmap}}, the development of the DialogMap prototype was performed in an agile and iterative manner, meaning that working prototypes could be presented and tried out by potential users. These potential users were a small group within a scientific citizen initiative. The cooperation was established through the second supervisor of this thesis. During the organization of MÃ¼nster-based, initiative-spanning sustainability project, a vague concept of a map based information delivery application emerged. According to this concept, citizens should be enabled to inform themselves about the different activities offered by the sustainability project through the map. This concept was then mutually transformed to match both the requirements of this thesis and the initial idea of the scientific citizen initiative. Not only should citizens be able to inform themselves through the map, but also engage each other in dialogs about the activities. Additionally, an agreement to participate in the evaluation of the research question was made. Through the cooperation, the opportunity to answer the research question with real-world users arised.\\
The requirements derived from the literature (\hyperref[sub:dialogmap]{section \ref{sub:dialogmap}}) formed a general framework for a spatial discussion platform, which guided the development of the DialogMap prototype. During the development phase, the small group of citizen activists contributed real-world suggestions and requirements according to their and the modified concept. The goal of the iterations was to deliver working prototypes in a monthly manner. These monthly prototypes were presented to the members of the scientific citizen initiative at monthly meetings. Through these monthly meetings it was possible to incorporate the reactions and suggestions to the current iteration into the next iterations. Additional communication was conducted via e-mail. Throughout the development process, a working instance of the current iteration was accessible to the members of the initiative.\\

\subsection{Evaluation methodology}
\label{subchap:ev_methodology}
For the assessment of the research question posed in the \hyperref[chap:introduction]{introduction} of this thesis, different evaluation methods were considered. Previous research in the field of participatory GIS and argumentation mapping suggested usability assessment through user studies with quantitative evaluation. As the focus of this thesis is on how the use of geospatially enhanced dialogs supports public deliberation, qualitative evaluation methods were chosen instead. Following the cooperation for the real-world use case, evaluation related to this real-world use case was chosen. Subsequently, semi-structured interviews with both members of the participating initiatives and other citizen initiatives, expert interviews and a focus group were chosen to answer the research question.

Through the cooperation with the scientific citizen initiative, contact to other citizen initiatives could be established. An initial request for participation at interviews for the developed prototype was sent to participating initiatives at the sustainability project via e-mail. Following this request, eight semi-structured, two expert interviews and a focus group with \todo{99} participants were conducted. In subsequent e-mails, a meeting with each respondent was scheduled, further explaining the value and purpose of the interviews. Except one expert interview, which was performed via video chat, all interviews were carried out in quiet and private places chosen by the respondents. After all legal requirements for recording interviews were met, each interview then was recorded and transcribed afterfwards using modified transcription rules by Kuckartz \cite{kuckartz2007} (\hyperref[transcriptionrules]{Appendix \ref{transcriptionrules}}). All evaluation steps were conducted in German.



\subsubsection{Semi-structured interviews}

Semi-structured interviews in respect to the future use

According to Helfferich \cite{helfferich2005}, semi-structured interviews enables the interviewer to explore emergent thoughts of respondents during the interviews thus allowing to modify the questioning accordingly.  She also gives suggestions on question design and structure of interviews. Following the advice of Hellferich, all questions in were narration prompts. Leading questions were avoided. Questions were structured in three parts. The functions and usage of the developed prototype were showcased before the questions. This was done either with a local installation or with a video recorded beforehand. The respondents were informed about the cooperation and the development of the prototype in advance by the scientific citizen initiative.

\textbf{Part I -- Public participation}\\
General questions about the understanding of public participation were asked at the beginning of the interviews. Involvement in their respective initiative was established through asking about the respondents role and function. This included past as well as current activities in public participation. As public participation is an important part of public deliberation, important personal aspects of public participation were retrieved. This also included the personal opinion on benefits and purposes of public participation. Lastly, respondents were asked to give an introduction to an ongoing or past project where communication bewteen actors played an important role. This should reveal how dialogs were incorporated and fostered in the past.

\textbf{Part II -- Planned usage of the prototype}\\
Respondents were asked to give an introduction to the project where the developed prototype will be deployed in the future to gain insights to target groups, editorial and anticipated contributions and incentives for dialogic contributions. Reasons for and against the deployment of the developed prototype in their respective projects were retrieved to find non-technical requirements as well as personal expectations related to dialogic discussions with citizens. Other use cases apart from public deliberation for a spatially enhanced discussion platform were asked at last in part II.

\textbf{Part III -- Supplementary questions}\\
Supplementary questions comprised of questions to assess knowledge of the respondent in the fields of spatial media, interactive mapping applications and spatially enhanced discussions. Respondents were asked about knowledge of applications and past usage respectively.

\subsubsection{Expert interviews}

In addition to the interviews with members of the participating citizen initiatives at the sustainability project, two expert interviews with domain experts of argumentation mapping and usability were conducted.
