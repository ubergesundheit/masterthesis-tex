\section{Discussion}
\label{chap:discussion}
Following the descriptive evaluation of the semi-structured interviews, expert interviews and focus group in \hyperref[chap:evaluation]{section \ref{chap:evaluation}}, \hyperref[sub:evaluation-results]{sub-section \ref{sub:evaluation-results}} will do an interpretation of the results of the evaluation steps. \hyperref[sub:method-discussion]{Sub-section \ref{sub:method-discussion}} will critically revisit the methodology described in \hyperref[chap:methodology]{section \ref{chap:methodology}}. Limitations of both methodology and evaluation techniques which emerged over the course of this thesis, will be described in \hyperref[sub:limitations]{sub-section \ref{sub:limitations}}.

\subsection{Evaluation Results}
\label{sub:evaluation-results}
According to the respondents of the semi-structured interviews, public deliberation enables citizens to actively influence their environment through self-determined organization. Easy access of information is seen as first step to initiate interest and spark discussions. The means currently used for this are generally unspecialized. Generally, tools are used to inform and educate citizens. Although many respondents mentioned the use of Internet pages, only one interviewee addressed the use of a wiki web application. 



No need for spatial discussion platforms is seen.



Spatial discussion platforms deployed in context of public deliberation

While both respondents of the semi-structured interviews and participants of the focus group evaluation were generally receptive to the concept of spatially enhanced dialogs, participants of the focus group evaluation showed doubts about broad acceptance of spatial discussion platforms.

Although \todo{seeing} benefits in spatially enhanced dialogs and understanding the concept, participants generally prefer 

the idea to support dialogs through spatially referenced discussions is generally well understood by the participants of the evaluation steps.
